1. 
Deactivate DNSStubListener and update DNS server address. Create a new file: /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/adguardhome.conf (create a /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d directory if necessary) with the following content:
[Resolve]
DNS=127.0.0.1
DNSStubListener=no

2. 
Specifying 127.0.0.1 as DNS server address is necessary because otherwise the nameserver will be 127.0.0.53 which doesn't work without DNSStubListener.
3. 
Activate another resolv.conf file:
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.backup

sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d
sudo cp /home/akash/dockerization/adguardhome/adguardhome.conf /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/
sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
4. 
Restart DNSStubListener:
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart systemd-resolved


Allow ports:

sudo ufw allow 80,443,3000,853,5443/tcp
